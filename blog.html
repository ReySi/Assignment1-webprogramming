          <p>After a short flight and a horrible train ride, I finally arrived in V&aumlxj&ouml, yey!<br>
          Since we have to wait until we can move in our appartment, we have to stay in a hostel for <br>
          a couple days. It's super beautiful here and we have a lake right in front of the hostel!</p>

          <p>I am back in Germany! The flight took 13 hours but honestly, it didn't feel too long.<br>
          We didn't have any interruptions but I waited for like 45 mins to get my luggage!</p>
